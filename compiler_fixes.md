# Tocin Compiler Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes made to address compilation errors in the Tocin compiler.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Error Code Definitions**
   - Added missing error code definitions in `error/error_handler.h`:
     - `B001_USE_AFTER_MOVE`
     - `B002_BORROW_CONFLICT`
     - `B003_MUTABILITY_ERROR`
     - `B004_MOVE_BORROWED_VALUE`
     - `P001_NON_EXHAUSTIVE_PATTERNS`

2. **AssignExpr Implementation**
   - Updated `AssignExpr` class to support both legacy and extended assignments
   - Added `target` field to store expression targets for complex assignments
   - Implemented `handleVariableAssignment` method to handle variable assignments
   - Added helper methods for variable lookup

3. **NullableType Implementation**
   - Fixed `NullableType` class in `ast/types.h` for nullable type system
   - Updated `NullSafetyChecker` to use the correct nullable type APIs

4. **Pattern Matching Fixes**
   - Updated code to use accessor methods instead of direct field access
   - Changed `pattern->name` to `pattern->getName()`
   - Changed `pattern->patterns` to `pattern->getArguments()`

5. **LLVM API Updates**
   - Fixed `CreateMalloc` calls to use the correct LLVM API signatures
   - Updated handling of opaque pointers
   - Fixed `getElementType()` usages with alternative approaches for opaque pointers

6. **Method Parameter Names**
   - Fixed method parameter name access in the `generateMethod` function
   - Updated to access names directly rather than through lexeme

7. **Malformed Code Block**
   - Removed/fixed incomplete function blocks

## Remaining Issues

1. **Opaque Pointer Handling**
   - Some code still relies on `getElementType()` for opaque pointers, which should be updated
   - Type information retrieval needs improvement for opaque pointers

2. **Type System Integration**
   - Better integration between the type system and code generation
   - Type checking in complex expressions could be improved

3. **Error Reporting**
   - Error messages could be more descriptive and context-aware
   - Line and column information should be consistent

4. **Memory Management**
   - Memory management is basic and could be improved
   - Proper memory cleanup isn't always performed

5. **Test Coverage**
   - The compiler would benefit from comprehensive test cases
   - Edge cases aren't well-tested

## Build Instructions

To build the Tocin compiler using MSYS2 MinGW64:

1. Open MSYS2 MINGW64 terminal from the Start menu
2. Navigate to the tocin-compiler directory:
   ```
   cd /c/Users/[username]/path/to/tocin-compiler
   ```
3. Clean the build directory:
   ```
   rm -rf build/*
   ```
4. Configure with CMake:
   ```
   cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -S . -B build
   ```
5. Build the project:
   ```
   cmake --build build
   ```
6. Create a package (optional):
   ```
   cmake --build build --target package
   ```

## Additional Notes

The compiler uses a combination of modern C++ features and LLVM APIs. When working with this codebase, be aware of:

1. C++17 features are used extensively
2. LLVM 15+ APIs with opaque pointers require special handling
3. The AST design follows a visitor pattern
4. Type checking happens separately from code generation
