## Build Environment Requirements

For successful compilation, you need:

1. A C++17 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
2. LLVM libraries (optional, as we have fallbacks)
3. Windows environment with PowerShell or Command Prompt

The provided build scripts will automatically detect available compilers and handle the build process.

## Resource Utilization

MSYS2/MinGW is currently the recommended Windows environment for development, as it includes all necessary tools and libraries.

# Progress Report: IR Generator Fixes

## Overview

We've undertaken a systematic effort to fix the IR generator implementation in the Tocin compiler to make it compatible with both the current AST structure and modern LLVM APIs. While we made significant progress in addressing various issues, there are still some challenges that need further attention.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed AST Structure Compatibility
- Updated the IR generator code to match the current AST class structure
- Fixed field access methods (using getter methods instead of direct field access)
- Updated handling of certain AST nodes like ForStmt, ListExpr, and DictionaryExpr
- Removed duplicate method definitions for several visitor methods

### 2. Fixed Error Code References
- Updated all error code references to match the current error handling system
- Changed `C004_CODEGEN_ERROR` to `C002_CODEGEN_ERROR`
- Changed `T002_WRONG_ARGUMENT_COUNT` to `T007_INCORRECT_ARGUMENT_COUNT`
- Ensured consistent error reporting throughout the code

### 3. Updated LLVM API Usage
- Fixed LLVM BasicBlock creation and insertion by using `insertInto(function)` instead of `getBasicBlockList().push_back()`
- Updated memory allocation methods by replacing `CreateArrayMalloc` with proper `CreateMalloc` calls
- Began addressing issues related to the deprecated `getPointerElementType()` method

### 4. Documentation Improvements
- Created comprehensive status report (IR_GENERATOR_STATUS.md)
- Updated build instructions with detailed troubleshooting guidance
- Documented common issues and recommendations for resolution

## Remaining Challenges

### 1. Compilation Issues
- Despite these fixes, the IR generator still fails to compile completely
- The error output is not detailed enough to identify the specific issues
- There may be additional LLVM API compatibility issues that need to be addressed

### 2. LLVM Integration
- Building with LLVM libraries in the MSYS2/MinGW environment remains problematic
- The exact headers and linking requirements need further investigation
- Version compatibility between the IR generator and installed LLVM packages needs verification

### 3. Incomplete PointerType Fixes
- Not all instances of `getPointerElementType()` have been replaced with `getElementType()`
- Some LLVM API usage patterns may still be outdated

## Recommendations

### Short-term Actions
1. **Create a minimal test case**
   - Develop a small test program that only uses essential LLVM features
   - Use this to validate LLVM installation and integration

2. **Add verbose error reporting**
   - Modify build scripts to provide more detailed error output
   - Capture complete compiler errors to identify specific issues

3. **Consider alternative build environments**
   - Try building with a different compiler or environment (e.g., Visual Studio)
   - Use a Docker container with a known-good LLVM setup

### Medium-term Actions
1. **Systematic LLVM API update**
   - Review all LLVM API usage against the documentation for the installed version
   - Create compatibility functions for API differences

2. **Add compilation flags for enabling/disabling components**
   - Allow building without the IR generator
   - Add configuration options for different LLVM versions

3. **Incremental testing strategy**
   - Develop test cases for each major IR generator function
   - Implement tests that exercise specific AST visitor methods

### Long-term Actions
1. **Consider a more flexible IR generation approach**
   - Evaluate using LLVM's C API instead of C++ API for better stability
   - Explore alternative IR generation libraries or approaches

2. **Create a comprehensive test suite**
   - Implement regression tests for each feature
   - Automate testing across different environments

3. **Update build documentation**
   - Document exact requirements for each supported platform
   - Create detailed troubleshooting guides

## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made in updating the IR generator to work with both the current AST structure and modern LLVM APIs. However, the integration with LLVM libraries in the build environment remains challenging. A focused effort on improving error reporting, testing with minimal examples, and potentially exploring alternative build environments would be the most effective next steps.
