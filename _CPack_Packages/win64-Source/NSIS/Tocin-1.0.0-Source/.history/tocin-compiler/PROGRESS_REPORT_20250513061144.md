# Tocin Compiler Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

1. **Documentation**
   - Completed the Standard Library documentation
   - Completed the Advanced Topics documentation
   - Created a comprehensive README with build instructions
   - Added LICENSE file (MIT License)

2. **Build System**
   - Fixed CMakeLists.txt to properly handle missing dependencies
   - Added a fallback system for missing LLVM headers
   - Created build scripts for Windows (build.ps1 and build.bat)
   - Added detailed BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md

3. **Core Language Structure**
   - Implemented AST structure with basic node types
   - Created lexer and parser
   - Implemented type system basic structure
   - Fixed C++17 compatibility issues

4. **Patterns & Pattern Matching**
   - Implemented pattern matching classes for use in match statements
   - Added wildcard, literal, variable, constructor, tuple, struct and OR patterns

5. **Concurrency Framework**
   - Implemented Promise/Future pattern for async programming
   - Added goroutine-like scheduling system

## Pending Tasks

1. **IR Generation**
   - The IR generator has numerous issues that need to be fixed:
     - Missing class members
     - Incorrect function signatures
     - Incomplete pattern handling
     - LLVM API compatibility issues

2. **Optimizer**
   - The LLVM optimization pipeline needs to be updated to work with the current LLVM version
   - Currently using a simplified placeholder implementation

3. **Runtime Library**
   - Standard library functions need to be implemented
   - Memory management functions (malloc/free) need proper wrappers

4. **Module System**
   - Import/export functionality implemented but needs testing
   - Module resolution logic requires refinement

5. **Error Reporting**
   - Error handling needs to be consistent across all compiler stages
   - Missing error codes for some error types

## Next Steps

1. Fix the IR generator implementation issues
2. Implement correct LLVM optimization pipeline
3. Complete the standard library implementations
4. Add comprehensive test suite
5. Improve error messages and diagnostics

## Known Issues

1. Class redefinition errors between header files
2. LLVM API version incompatibilities
3. Incomplete pattern matching implementation
4. Incorrect type handling in multiple areas
5. Memory management strategy needs improvement

## Build Environment Requirements

For successful compilation, you need:

1. A C++17 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
2. LLVM libraries (optional, as we have fallbacks)
3. Windows environment with PowerShell or Command Prompt

The provided build scripts will automatically detect available compilers and handle the build process.

## Resource Utilization

MSYS2/MinGW is currently the recommended Windows environment for development, as it includes all necessary tools and libraries.

## IR Generator Update - May 13, 2025

### Accomplished

1. **Code Structure Fixes**:
   - Updated the IR generator to match the current AST structure
   - Fixed error code references to use the proper error codes
   - Updated type handling to use BasicType and SimpleType correctly
   - Fixed token access in expressions and statements
   - Updated LLVM API calls to handle older/newer API versions

2. **Systematic Error Resolution**:
   - Identified and fixed class field access issues
   - Updated references to token values and lexemes
   - Fixed pointer element type access
   - Added better null checking throughout the code

3. **Build System Improvements**:
   - Updated build scripts to better handle LLVM linking
   - Added proper error handling to build scripts
   - Created test files to isolate LLVM integration issues
   - Added diagnostics to the build process

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created IR_GENERATOR_STATUS.md with detailed status report
   - Updated BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md with LLVM integration guidance
   - Documented workarounds for common build issues

### Remaining Challenges

1. **LLVM Integration**: 
   - Still facing issues with LLVM library/header integration in MSYS2/MinGW
   - Need to resolve linking errors for full compilation

2. **IR Generation Testing**:
   - Once linkage is successful, need to test IR generation with test cases
   - May need to adapt to different LLVM versions

### Next Steps

1. Complete the LLVM library integration
2. Test IR generation with sample Tocin code
3. Implement missing IR generation features
4. Optimize the IR generation process
