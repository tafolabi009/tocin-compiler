# Tocin Language Enhancement Roadmap

This document outlines the plan to enhance the Tocin language by incorporating the best features from other programming languages while avoiding their drawbacks.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Safety**: Prevent common errors at compile time
2. **Performance**: Generate efficient code with minimal runtime overhead
3. **Productivity**: Provide modern features that increase developer productivity
4. **Flexibility**: Allow different programming paradigms
5. **Interoperability**: Easy integration with existing code and libraries

## Features to Implement

### From Rust

1. **Ownership and Borrowing**
   - Memory safety without garbage collection
   - Compile-time tracking of resource lifetimes
   - Implementation plan:
     - Extend type system with ownership attributes
     - Add borrow checker to validate references
     - Modify IR generator to handle ownership semantics

2. **Result and Option Types**
   - Explicit error handling without exceptions
   - No null references, use Option instead
   - Implementation plan:
     - Add built-in generic Result<T, E> and Option<T> types
     - Add pattern matching for these types
     - Extend compiler to optimize pattern matching

### From Go

1. **Goroutines and Channels**
   - Lightweight concurrency with message passing
   - Implementation plan:
     - Add goroutine keyword for launching concurrent functions
     - Implement channel type for communication
     - Extend IR generator to use a task scheduler runtime

2. **Deferred Execution**
   - Simplify resource cleanup with defer
   - Implementation plan:
     - Add defer statement
     - Modify IR generator to track and execute deferred calls

### From C#

1. **Properties**
   - Encapsulated access to class fields
   - Implementation plan:
     - Add property syntax sugar
     - Generate accessor methods during compilation

2. **LINQ-style Operations**
   - Declarative data processing
   - Implementation plan:
     - Add extension methods to collection types
     - Implement lazy evaluation for efficiency

### From Kotlin/Swift

1. **Null Safety**
   - Prevents null reference errors
   - Implementation plan:
     - Add nullable type notation (Type?)
     - Enforce null checks at compile time
     - Add safe call operator (?.) and elvis operator (?:)

2. **Extension Functions**
   - Add methods to existing types without inheritance
   - Implementation plan:
     - Extend syntax to allow defining functions on existing types
     - Modify name resolution in type checker

### From Haskell/Functional Languages

1. **Pattern Matching**
   - Comprehensive pattern matching on data structures
   - Implementation plan:
     - Add match expression
     - Support destructuring in patterns
     - Add exhaustiveness checking

2. **Type Classes/Traits**
   - Ad-hoc polymorphism without inheritance
   - Implementation plan:
     - Add trait/interface definitions
     - Add implementation/conformance declarations
     - Extend type checker for trait bounds

### From Modern C++

1. **Move Semantics**
   - Efficient transfer of resources
   - Implementation plan:
     - Add move constructors and operators
     - Implement move analysis in optimizer

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 months)
- Fix current compiler issues
- Improve error handling and reporting
- Enhance the type system to support advanced features

### Phase 2: Memory Safety (2-3 months)
- Implement ownership and borrowing system
- Add Result and Option types
- Implement null safety

### Phase 3: Concurrency (2-3 months)
- Implement goroutines and channels
- Add defer statement
- Build runtime library for concurrency support

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (3-4 months)
- Implement pattern matching
- Add traits/interfaces
- Add extension functions
- Implement properties

### Phase 5: Optimization and Tooling (2-3 months)
- Enhance the optimizer for new language features
- Implement IDE tooling and language server
- Add documentation generator

## Breaking Changes and Migration

Some enhancements will require breaking changes to the language. We will:

1. Document all breaking changes thoroughly
2. Provide migration guides
3. Create automatic migration tools where possible
4. Maintain backward compatibility where feasible

## Development Approach

1. Each feature will be developed on a separate branch
2. Comprehensive tests will be written before merging
3. Language specification will be updated in parallel
4. Regular language previews will be released for feedback

By focusing on these enhancements, Tocin will become a powerful, safe, and productive language that combines the best aspects of modern programming languages.
