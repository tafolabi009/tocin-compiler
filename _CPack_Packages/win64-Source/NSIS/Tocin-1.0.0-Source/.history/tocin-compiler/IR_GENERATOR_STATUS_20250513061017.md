# IR Generator Status Report

## Current Status

The IR generator has been updated to match the current AST structure and error codes. The following issues have been fixed:

1. Updated error codes:
   - Changed `C004_CODEGEN_ERROR` to `C002_CODEGEN_ERROR`
   - Changed `T005_UNDEFINED_VARIABLE` to `T002_UNDEFINED_VARIABLE`
   - Changed `T003_TYPE_INFERENCE_FAILED` to `T009_CANNOT_INFER_TYPE`

2. Fixed type-related issues:
   - Updated `TypeReference` to `BasicType` with proper `getKind()` method usage
   - Added handling for `SimpleType` class

3. Fixed token access:
   - Updated direct field access in LiteralExpr (value, literalType)
   - Updated direct field access in VariableExpr (name)
   - Updated direct field access in VariableStmt (name)
   - Updated direct field access in AssignExpr (name)

4. Fixed LLVM API compatibility issues:
   - Replaced `getPointerElementType()` with proper type checking using `llvm::dyn_cast<llvm::PointerType>` and `getElementType()`
   - Added null checks to handle nullable values safely

## Remaining Issues

1. **LLVM Library/Header Integration**:
   Despite the code fixes, there are still compilation issues when trying to build with LLVM libraries in the MSYS2/MinGW environment. The compiler cannot find the required LLVM headers or is having linking errors.

2. **Build System Configuration**:
   The build scripts have been improved to handle errors better and provide more detailed output, but there are likely issues with how the LLVM libraries are being linked that need to be resolved.

## Recommendations

1. **Validate LLVM Installation**:
   - Check if all required LLVM development packages are installed in the MSYS2/MinGW environment
   - Verify the LLVM version compatibility with the code

2. **Isolate LLVM Integration**:
   - Create minimal test cases to isolate LLVM integration issues
   - Gradually add functionality to identify specific breakpoints

3. **Consider Alternative Approaches**:
   - If LLVM integration continues to be problematic, consider:
     - Using a different build environment (like Visual Studio with LLVM package)
     - Using a containerized build environment with a known working LLVM setup
     - Temporarily disabling the IR generator to focus on other parts of the compiler

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update build instructions to include specific LLVM version requirements
   - Document any workarounds needed for different environments

## Progress Made

The IR generator code is now syntactically correct and aligned with the current codebase's structure. The remaining issues are primarily related to the build environment and library integration rather than the code itself.
