# Getting Started with Tocin

This guide will help you set up your development environment, install the Tocin compiler, and write your first Tocin program.

## System Requirements

Tocin can be installed on the following operating systems:

- **Windows**: Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
- **macOS**: 10.14 (Mojave) or later
- **Linux**: Most modern distributions including Ubuntu 18.04+, Debian 10+, Fedora 32+, and CentOS 8+

Hardware requirements:
- 2 GHz dual-core processor or better
- 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended)
- 1 GB disk space for the Tocin toolchain and standard library

## Installing Tocin

### Using the Official Installer

1. Download the latest Tocin installer from the [official website](https://tocin.io/downloads).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running:

```bash
tocin --version
```

This should display the version of the Tocin compiler you installed.

### Using Package Managers

#### Windows (via Chocolatey)

```bash
choco install tocin
```

#### macOS (via Homebrew)

```bash
brew install tocin
```

#### Linux (via Apt for Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tocin
```

### Building from Source

For advanced users who want to build Tocin from source:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler (GCC 8+, Clang 10+, or MSVC 2019+), CMake 3.15+, and Git installed.
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tocin-lang/tocin-compiler.git
cd tocin-compiler
```

3. Build the compiler:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

4. Install the compiler:

```bash
cmake --install .
```

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Command Line Tools

The basic Tocin installation includes:

- `tocin`: The compiler
- `tocin-fmt`: Code formatter
- `tocin-doc`: Documentation generator
- `tocin-pkg`: Package manager

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Support

Tocin has excellent IDE support through plugins:

#### Visual Studio Code

1. Install Visual Studio Code
2. Open the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Tocin"
4. Install the "Tocin Language Support" extension

The extension provides:
- Syntax highlighting
- Code completion
- Error diagnostics
- Code navigation
- Refactoring tools

#### JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, CLion, etc.)

1. Open Settings/Preferences
2. Go to Plugins > Marketplace
3. Search for "Tocin"
4. Install the "Tocin" plugin

#### Other Editors

- **Vim/Neovim**: Install the `tocin.vim` plugin
- **Emacs**: Install the `tocin-mode` package
- **Sublime Text**: Install the "Tocin" package from Package Control

## Your First Tocin Program

Let's write a simple "Hello, World!" program to verify your setup.

1. Create a new file named `hello.to`
2. Add the following code:

```tocin
def main() -> int {
    println("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```

3. Compile and run the program:

```bash
tocin build hello.to
./hello
```

You should see "Hello, World!" printed to the console.

### Understanding the Hello World Program

Let's break down the Hello World program:

```tocin
def main() -> int {
    println("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```

- `def main() -> int {`: Defines the main function, which is the entry point of the program. It returns an integer.
- `println("Hello, World!");`: Calls the `println` function to print a string to the console.
- `return 0;`: Returns the value 0, indicating successful execution.

## Creating a More Complex Program

Let's create a slightly more complex program that calculates the factorial of a number:

```tocin
def factorial(n: int) -> int {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

def main() -> int {
    println("Calculate factorials");
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        println("Factorial of " + i.toString() + " is " + factorial(i).toString());
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

Save this as `factorial.to`, then compile and run it:

```bash
tocin build factorial.to
./factorial
```

## Project Structure

For larger projects, Tocin uses a project structure with a configuration file. Here's how to create a new project:

1. Create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
```

2. Initialize a new Tocin project:

```bash
tocin init
```

This creates a basic project structure:

```
my_project/
├── src/
│   └── main.to
├── tests/
├── .gitignore
└── tocin.toml
```

3. The `tocin.toml` file contains your project configuration:

```toml
[package]
name = "my_project"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]

[dependencies]
# Add dependencies here
```

4. Build and run your project:

```bash
tocin build
./out/my_project
```

## Using the Package Manager

Tocin has a built-in package manager called `tocin-pkg`. Here's how to use it:

1. Add a dependency to your `tocin.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
json = "1.0.2"
```

2. Install the dependency:

```bash
tocin-pkg install
```

3. Use the package in your code:

```tocin
import json;

def main() -> int {
    let data = json.parse("{\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}");
    println("Name: " + data["name"].toString());
    return 0;
}
```

## Debugging

Tocin integrates with common debuggers like GDB and LLDB. To compile with debug information:

```bash
tocin build --debug
```

Then use your debugger:

```bash
gdb ./out/my_project
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've set up your environment and written your first programs, you're ready to explore more of what Tocin has to offer:

1. Continue to [Language Basics](03_Language_Basics.md) to learn more about Tocin's syntax and features
2. Explore the [Standard Library](04_Standard_Library.md) to see what built-in functionality is available
3. Check out the [Tocin Cookbook](../cookbook/README.md) for practical examples and recipes

Happy coding!
