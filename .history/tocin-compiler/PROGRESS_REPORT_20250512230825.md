# Tocin Compiler Progress Report

## Recent Accomplishments

1. **Documentation Completion**
   - Completed the Standard Library documentation (04_Standard_Library.md)
   - Completed the Advanced Topics documentation (05_Advanced_Topics.md)

2. **Build System Improvements**
   - Created an MIT license file to satisfy the CMakeLists.txt requirement
   - Modified CMakeLists.txt to properly handle license requirements

3. **LLVM Dependency Handling**
   - Created a robust `llvm_shim.h` fallback header to handle missing LLVM headers
   - Added `target_info.h` to provide system detection for proper target triple resolution
   - Updated main.cpp to use the shim header instead of directly including problematic LLVM headers

4. **Direct Build Support**
   - Created PowerShell build script (build.ps1) for Windows users
   - Created Batch file build script (build.bat) for Windows command prompt users
   - Added detailed build instructions in BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md

## Current Issues

1. **Compilation Errors**
   - Missing include file: `stmt.h` in ast/match_stmt.h
   - Syntax error in lexer: C++17 compatibility issue with `unordered_map.contains()` 
   - AST class declaration errors:
     - Field 'aliases' referenced but not declared in ImportStmt
     - BasicType and TypeKind not declared in StringInterpolationExpr::getType()
     - Double definition of StringInterpolationExpr::accept method
   - TypeChecker constructor mismatch
   - Token constructor with no parameters used but not defined

## Next Steps

1. **Fix AST Hierarchy Issues**
   - Create missing header files (e.g., stmt.h)
   - Fix circular dependencies in the AST classes
   - Ensure proper constructors are defined for all classes

2. **Compatibility Improvements**
   - Replace C++20 features like `unordered_map.contains()` with C++17 alternatives
   - Ensure constructor definitions match their declarations

3. **Continue Integration with LLVM**
   - Work on a more robust error handler for LLVM errors
   - Add more fallback implementations for commonly used LLVM functions

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Create simple test cases to verify core functionality
   - Develop a test framework for the compiler

## Build Environment Requirements

For successful compilation, you need:

1. A C++17 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
2. LLVM libraries (optional, as we have fallbacks)
3. Windows environment with PowerShell or Command Prompt

The provided build scripts will automatically detect available compilers and handle the build process.

## Resource Utilization

MSYS2/MinGW is currently the recommended Windows environment for development, as it includes all necessary tools and libraries.
