# IR Generator Status Report

## Summary of Changes Made

We've made the following key changes to fix compatibility issues between the IR generator implementation and the current AST structure:

1. **Fixed Error Code References**:
   - Changed `C004_CODEGEN_ERROR` to `C002_CODEGEN_ERROR`
   - Changed `T002_WRONG_ARGUMENT_COUNT` to `T007_INCORRECT_ARGUMENT_COUNT`
   - Fixed similar error code mismatches throughout the code

2. **Fixed LLVM API Incompatibilities**:
   - Replaced `CreateArrayMalloc` calls with proper `CreateMalloc` calls
   - Updated `BasicBlockList` handling to use the modern `insertInto(function)` method instead of the private `getBasicBlockList().push_back()`
   - Fixed pointer type handling with proper casting and safe access
   - Updated code to support LLVM's transition to opaque pointers

3. **Removed Duplicate Method Definitions**:
   - Removed duplicate definitions of `visitNewExpr`, `visitVariableExpr`, and `visitAssignExpr` methods

4. **Fixed AST Class Structure Mismatches**:
   - Updated handling in `visitForStmt` to use the current `ForStmt` structure
   - Fixed `ListExpr` and `DictionaryExpr` to use `getType()` method instead of direct field access
   - Fixed `MatchStmt` handling to use the right field names
   - Updated handling of `NewExpr` to use getter methods

## Remaining Issues

Despite these fixes, the following issues likely remain:

1. **LLVM Opaque Pointer Transition**:
   - LLVM 15+ has transitioned from typed pointers to opaque pointers
   - Code using `getPointerElementType()` and some usages of `getElementType()` need to be updated
   - Need to maintain type information separately rather than embedded in pointer types
   - Methods like `PointerType::get(elementType, addressSpace)` should be replaced with `PointerType::get(context, addressSpace)`

2. **Additional AST Mismatches**:
   - There may be remaining issues with `ForStmt`, `ImportStmt`, `ExportStmt`, and `ModuleStmt` class structures
   - Some visitor methods might still be using outdated field names or methods
   - Need to ensure all AST accessor methods are properly used (e.g., getters instead of direct field access)

3. **Environment and Build System Issues**:
   - LLVM library integration in MSYS2/MinGW environment may have compatibility problems
   - Include paths and library linking need to be verified

## Recommendations

1. **Comprehensive LLVM API Update**:
   - Create a systematic approach to update all instances of deprecated or changed LLVM API calls
   - Implement a compatibility layer to handle differences between LLVM versions
   - Update all pointer type handling for opaque pointers compatibility

2. **AST Structure Verification**:
   - Compare all AST class usage in IR generator with current AST definitions
   - Update each visitor method to match the current AST structure

3. **Build System Improvements**:
   - Update CMake configuration to properly handle LLVM integration
   - Add detailed error reporting during build to better identify issues
   - Consider using a newer version of LLVM if possible

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Create small, targeted test cases for each component
   - Implement incremental testing to isolate problem areas

## Next Steps

1. Update code to handle LLVM's opaque pointer transition
2. Review each AST visitor method in the IR generator against the current AST class definitions
3. Update the build scripts to provide better diagnostics
4. Create a set of minimal test cases to verify each component works correctly

## Verifying LLVM Installation

To verify your LLVM installation and check compatibility with our project, run:

```bash
llvm-config --version --components --libs core analysis irreader support
```

This command will display:
- The LLVM version installed on your system
- Available components
- Libraries needed for basic functionality

For our project, we need LLVM 14.0 or higher due to API changes. Make sure the output shows compatible versions.

## Conclusion

The IR generator code structure has been significantly improved, but there are still issues to resolve. A methodical approach focusing on LLVM API compatibility (especially for opaque pointers) and AST structure alignment will be needed to complete the integration.
