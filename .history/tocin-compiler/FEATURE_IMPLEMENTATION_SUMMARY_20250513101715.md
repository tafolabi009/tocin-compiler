# Feature Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate advanced language features into the Tocin compiler.

## 1. Core Features Implemented

We've implemented the following language features:

1. **Ownership and Borrowing**: Rust-like ownership system for memory safety without garbage collection
2. **Result/Option Types**: Explicit error handling with pattern matching
3. **Goroutines and Channels**: Go-like concurrency with message passing
4. **Deferred Execution**: Cleanup operations that run when a scope exits
5. **Properties**: Class properties with custom getters and setters
6. **LINQ-style Operations**: Query operations for collections
7. **Null Safety**: Kotlin/Swift-style null handling with safe operators
8. **Extension Functions**: Methods added to existing types without inheritance
9. **Type Classes/Traits**: Rust-like traits for polymorphism
10. **Move Semantics**: C++-like move semantics for efficient resource transfer

## 2. Implementation Approach

All features were implemented following these principles:

1. **Header-only approach**: Features are defined in header files for simplicity during prototyping
2. **Clean separation of concerns**: Each feature has its own header file
3. **Integration through a common interface**: The `FeatureManager` class
4. **Visitor pattern compatibility**: AST nodes defined for each feature
5. **Minimal changes to existing code**: Features plug into the compiler without major refactoring

## 3. Integration Process

The integration into the compiler followed these steps:

1. Created the `FeatureManager` class as a unified interface to all features
2. Updated the `Compiler` class to initialize and hold a `FeatureManager` instance
3. Modified the `TypeChecker` to accept a `FeatureManager` pointer
4. Updated `CMakeLists.txt` to include all new feature files
5. Documented all features in `IMPLEMENTED_FEATURES.md`

## 4. File Structure

New files created:

```

├── type/
│   ├── ownership.h              # Ownership and borrowing
│   ├── result_option.h          # Result and Option types

│   ├── extension_functions.h    # Extension functions
│   ├── traits.h                 # Type classes/traits

└── ast/
    ├── defer_stmt.h             # Deferred execution
    └── property.h               # Properties
```

## 5. Required Next Steps

To fully complete the implementation, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Implement visitor methods**: Add specific visitor methods for each new AST node type
2. **Add code generation**: Implement IR generation for each feature
3. **Update parser**: Extend the parser to recognize the new syntax
4. **Add integration tests**: Create tests for each feature
5. **Documentation**: Complete language reference guides for each feature

## 6. Integration with Type Checker

The type checker now accepts a `FeatureManager` instance, which provides access to:

1. **Ownership checking**: Track variable lifetimes and borrowing
2. **Advanced type verification**: For Result/Option types, traits, etc.
3. **Null safety validation**: Ensure proper handling of nullable types
4. **Code pattern recognition**: For ownership patterns, LINQ queries, etc.

## 7. CMake Integration

We've updated the CMake build system to:

1. Include all new header files in the compilation
2. Keep all feature files organized
3. Ensure proper dependencies between components

## 8. Conclusion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a modern programming language with advanced features. The modular approach allows for incremental improvement and evolution of each feature while maintaining a cohesive language design.
